    <h1>Pipe flow challenge</h1>

    <p>
        You are in charge of Yorks water network. The side of the network
        furthest from the source is not receiving enough water, despite an
        unlimited supply. You are tasked with writing some code which, using the
        JSON representation of the network, can find the maximum flow from the
        start to the end of the network, and also find which pipes are causing
        the bottleneck so their capacity can be increased.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are ten nodes in the network, numbered <strong>0</strong> to <strong>9</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>0</strong> is the water source, <strong>9</strong> is the dried up area.
    </p>
